**numbro 1.50** has been released.

We are proud to announce a new release of numbro today.
Actually, we did tree releases today (we like to keep them small).

Basically, it brings now support for Hebrew (thanks to [@eli-zehavi](https://github.com/eli-zehavi)), automatic load of all languages for node users (thanks to [@alexkwolfe](https://github.com/alexkwolfe)), and an improvement in the decimal accuracy when minified (thanks to [@rafde](https://github.com/rafde)).

I hope you will have fun with this new release,

Enjoy <i class="fa fa-smile-o">
